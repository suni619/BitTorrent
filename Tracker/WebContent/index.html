          <p class="text-justify" draggable="true">BitTorrent is a protocol for the practice of peer-to-peer file sharing
            that is used to distribute large amounts of data over the Internet. BitTorrent
            is one of the most common protocols for transferring large files, and peer-to-peer
            networks have been estimated to collectively account for approximately
            43% to 70% of all Internet traffic (depending on geographical location)
            as of February 2009. In November 2004, BitTorrent was responsible for 35%
            of all Internet traffic. As of February 2013, BitTorrent was responsible
            for 3.35% of all worldwide bandwidth, more than half of the 6% of total
            bandwidth dedicated to file sharing.&nbsp;
            <br>
            <br>Programmer Bram Cohen, a former University at Buffalo graduate student
            in Computer Science, designed the protocol in April 2001 and released the
            first available version on 2 July 2001, and the final version in 2008.
            BitTorrent clients are available for a variety of computing platforms and
            operating systems including an official client released by Bittorrent,
            Inc.&nbsp;
            <br>
            <br>As of January 2012, BitTorrent is utilized by 150 million active users
            (according to BitTorrent, Inc.). Based on this figure, the total number
            of monthly BitTorrent users can be estimated at more than a quarter of
            a billion.
